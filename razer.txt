Foreman's like what can that thing do with the top-end but personally I'm just drawn to this time the Six Nations special was that crazy cool scream okay
or watching movies at high-resolution fantastic but then we switch the gameplay you want that fast to refresh rate but also a native resolution at that this can do it I've never seen any other game laptop pull this off now check this out this display uses many LEDs for the backlighting to get great contrast ratios but the thing that really blew and the screen is how bright again look at this go so I picked the sun will hit 1,000 mints and that's not a thousand it's in like one section on a blacksmith it's a thousand its sustained across the whole panel it's ridiculously bright screen or can get ridiculously bright eyes like half brightness
Teresa recently announced a new blades 16 and 18 these are all new chassis this year but just up front this videos being recorded before the Nvidia embargo so I cannot Benchmark or play games on a list of I can't test these devices in terms of the performance capabilities but I was able to check out their kind of design language and just the things that they've changed this year because of the overall package on a lot of cool stuff going on for the 16 1st right off the bat this is got a 16 by 10 aspect ratio but the kicker is Abyss has native resolution switching so we can switch between a 1080p 240 hertz panel and then switch to a 4K 120 horsepower are both native resolution so the idea being you can use that high resolution for Creative work right you want the clean pit bulls really sharp images
and it's beautiful it comes with a bit of a change in form factor so this is last year's 15 inch blade and the horizontal dimension
Delhi attack and is also no native resolution switching it's just a big awesome screen so if you're looking for that desktop replacement like 18 inch screen know with that extra screen real-estate you also get more space on the inside and this is why the 80's model can be equipped with the top of the line configuration so you get that 13988 checks from Intel like they're super fast monster chip and you get higher wattage on the seat fuse to get 65 W for the H&H models of the larger screen razors kept the classic racer look to their ancient devices got the same kind of keyboard with RGB lighting they're the same kind of tripod speaker placement it really is just a more spacious regular Razer laptop sticker bigger way more powerful but yeah
like Intel and Nvidia they are making more powerful to buy more powerful components for there for the laptop industry and these Palmer wattage and the truth is the more water you put into something you have you need to figure a way to cooler and the way that razor has been cooling the devices in the past I feel like I just reached a limit you can only do so much in his life Vapor Chambers and thermal compound to cool it properly you have to go sticker at some point and this is what they did this yourself for the new 16 and 18 blade razor has thicker and heavier devices than they normally would and it's all to just make room for the more powerful component on the inside higher wattage across the board and you just need a thicker device to do it now a quick note of performance so I was shown some sentiment runs on the 16 inch blade using the 13 950 a check and I can hit some monster numbers even had some scores at bro
most interested in is what this device can do with their tuning software and that top-spec ship from until like we saw at 32,000 score what can this thing do at the top end okay I'll wrap up this video with a peek at the inside so these are pre-production units they're not guaranteed to be finalized Hardware but on the 8-inch device and take a look at the inside of your big Vapor chamber here is a few Angie Pugh if to Ram slots to MVP slots at a 91.7 what are battery and you have that third fan that razor puts on their big laptops the 16-inch device also has two Ram spots and 2nd nice place but these are stacked one on top of each other is a 95 yr battery in the bottom as well as that large Vapor chamber up top but those are the two new blades from a razor I'm particularly interested to see the 18 in
32000 I don't know that's an anomaly or something but clearly they have found a way to cool a properly cuz you cannot hit numbers like that on an improperly cool laptop no way regardless of what the chip is inside right and they also some tuna features in the works that allows their blades 16 and 18 with a push Beyond factory-spec okay enough of the 16 let's talk with the 18 it's a little bit bigger than last year is longer it's wider its thicker and heavier but against all in pursuit of just better performance you when you have powerful components that need that kind of breathing room to cool properly you got a bump up the size and they've done it now the main feature of this year's Ethan blade is it in this is a absolutely stunning strength 60% aspect ratio QVC Plus in 240 hertz there's no
